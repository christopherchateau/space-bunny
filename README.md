# Game Time - Space Bunny

During Module 2 of our studies at the Turing School of Software and Design, Jessica Erickson and I were tasked with recreating the classic game "Frogger" using the HTML Canvas API, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Local Storage, and an existing code base. For our interpretation, we envisioned an astronaut bunny exploring the surface of the moon. At the end of her mission, she needs to return to the Bunny Moon Space Station, and so do all of her bunny friends. We have a similar score setup to the original "Frogger": 

1. For each position the bunny gains, the player scores 10 points.

2. For each bunny that makes it home, the player scores 50 points.

3. For the first game, the player sets a hi-score.

4. On subsequent games, if the player's score is greater than their hi-score, their score is saved as the new hi-score.
